# HELP'S KITCHEN

A simple yet powerful web application to help ease restaurant management. Allows waiters to select items a customer orders, places the order into a queue and alerts the kitchen staff. Afterwards, the order is verified by the wait staff and then automatically removed from the queue. Customers can review and comment their experience to help provide helpful feedback viewable by all parties. Management users are able to view orders, price trends, and other data as needed.
